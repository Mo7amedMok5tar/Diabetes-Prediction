# Diabetes Prediction App

## Project Overview
This project is a Diabetes Prediction application designed to assess an individual's risk of diabetes based on several input features. By utilizing a trained machine learning model, users can input their health data, and the application will predict whether they are likely to be diabetic or not.

## Features
- **User Input:** Users can input various health metrics, including:
  - Number of pregnancies
  - Blood glucose level
  - Blood insulin level
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Age
  - Skin thickness
- **Prediction:** The application provides a prediction based on the input data.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for insightful visualizations of the dataset and analysis results.
- **Data Analysis and Cleaning:** Conducts data analysis and cleaning to ensure high-quality input data.
- **Clear Output:** Users can clear the prediction results easily.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
